Test task has 2 documents attached:
1. Currency calculator - excel file with several sheets, which has some feature details (useful notes), checklists (smoke and functional), bus and improvements.
Some comments are added across the whole doc to better represent my ideas (given this is the test task and some important information about the requirements is unavailable).
2. Test result report word document.

Checklists that are added inside excel doc can be easily reused / extended in case such need comes up. 

Approximate time to complete the task (including documentation creation) is about 9-10 hours.
